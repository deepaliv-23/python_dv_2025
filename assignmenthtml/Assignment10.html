        <h2>Cartoon</h2>
        <p>
            A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic 
            style. The specific meaning has evolved, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images 
            intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its 
            animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist, and in the second sense they 
            are usually called an animator. The concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing 
            for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, beginning in 
            Punch magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous artworks in magazines and newspapers. 
            Then it also was used for political cartoons and comic strips. When the medium developed, in the early 20th century, it 
            began to refer to animated films that resembled print cartoons.

        <h4>in short about cartoon</h4>
        <p>
            The concept of cartoons originated in the Middle Ages, initially describing preparatory drawings for artworks like 
            paintings and tapestries. In the 19th century, particularly with the publication of Punch magazine in 1843, the term 
            began to denote humorous illustrations in print media. By the early 20th century, it expanded to include animated 
            films that resembled print cartoons.
