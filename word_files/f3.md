JavaScript Basics: Variables
🔹 Introduction to Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that can be used and modified later.

Step 1: Declare a variable.
var firstname;

Step 2: Assign it some information.
firstname = "Hiral Shewale";

Step 3: Use it.
console.log(firstname); // Output: Hiral Shewale

Step 4: Change it.
firstname = "Hiri";
console.log(firstname); // Output: Hiri

🛑 JavaScript is case sensitive.
✳️ It is good practice to use "use strict"; at the beginning of your code to catch common coding mistakes and prevent certain issues.

🧠 Rules for Naming Variables
Cannot start with a number

js
Copy
Edit
var value1 = 10;  // ✅ Valid
var 1value = 10;  // ❌ Invalid
Only underscore _ and dollar sign $ are allowed among special characters

js
Copy
Edit
var _firstname = "Hiral";
var $lastname = "Shewale";
No spaces allowed in variable names

js
Copy
Edit
var first Name = "Invalid";  // ❌ Invalid
var first_name = "Valid";    // ✅ Snake Case
var firstName = "Valid";     // ✅ Camel Case
⚙️ Performing Operations on Variables
JavaScript allows basic math operations using variables:

js
Copy
Edit
var value1 = 10;
console.log(value1 / 2);  // Division
console.log(value1 * 2);  // Multiplication
console.log(value1 + 2);  // Addition
console.log(value1 - 2);  // Subtraction
console.log(value1 ** 2); // Exponentiation (10^2 = 100)
console.log(value1 ** 0.5); // Square Root
✅ JS Naming Convention for Variables
Use camelCase for naming variables.

js
Copy
Edit
var firstName = "Hiral"; // ✅ Recommended
You can also use snake_case, but it's less common in JS.

js
Copy
Edit
var first_name = "Hiral";
