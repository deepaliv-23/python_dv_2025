JavaScript: var, let, and const
JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.

🟩 var Keyword
var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript.

It has function scope, and allows re-declaration of the same variable.

✅ Example:
js
Copy
Edit
var firstName = "Yatin";   // Declare
firstName = "Siddesh";     // Update
var firstName = "Mohit";   // Re-declare (Allowed)
console.log(firstName);    // Output: Mohit
⚠️ Because of this behavior, var can sometimes lead to unexpected results, so it's less commonly used now.

🟦 let Keyword
Introduced to solve some problems with var.

Has block scope.

Cannot re-declare the same variable within the same scope.

Can update the value.

✅ Example:
js
Copy
Edit
let first_Name = "Sachin";  // Declare
first_Name = "Rohit";       // Update
// let first_Name = "Siddhi";  ❌ Error: Already declared
console.log(first_Name);    // Output: Rohit
✅ Use let when you expect the value of the variable to change.

🟥 const Keyword
Used to declare constants (values that don’t change).

Has block scope.

Cannot be updated or re-declared.

✅ Example:
js
Copy
Edit
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);        // Output: 3.14
❌ Invalid:
js
Copy
Edit
pi = 3.15;              // Error: Assignment to constant variable
❗ You must assign a value at the time of declaration with const.
